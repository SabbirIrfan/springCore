How AOP works!!
    1::Define Aspects: Identify cross-cutting concerns and create aspects with advice and pointcuts.

    2::Write Advice: Implement behavior associated with concerns using "before," "after," or "around" advice.

    3::Define Pointcuts: Specify criteria using expressions to identify where advice should be applied.

    4::Weaving: Integrate aspects into the codebase through compile-time or runtime weaving.

    5::Apply Aspects: Use annotations or configuration to apply aspects to target code.

    6::Execute Application: Run the application, and AOP framework ensures aspect integration.

    7::Verify and Maintain: Confirm effective application, maintain, and update aspects as needed.


In Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), developers identify concerns, implement behavior, specify application
points, integrate aspects, apply them, execute the application, and maintain modularized cross-cutting concerns
for improved code manageability and readability.
